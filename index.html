well-designed OO code using such a library. GUI components are a
canonical use-case where an OO design makes sense. I suggest you skim

communication, I had us look up our internal IP addresses. Please see
<a href="E.html" data-pltdoc="x">E &#8212;<wbr></wbr> TCP</a> for the details of those communications, including the
expected behavior for <span class="stt">xtcp</span>.</p><p>This post recapitulates some of what we saw in class w/<span class="stt">tcp</span>
communication over <span class="stt">netcat</span>, and also explains why you might have
some difficulties trying this at home. You should try this at home,
and get it to work&#8212;<wbr></wbr>this will be good practice for you.</p><p>On a computer with internal IP address 2.3.4.5, I typed the following:</p><p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="SVerbatim"><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">$ nc -l 3000</span></p></td></tr></table></p><p>That commands tells this terminal session to start a program on this
computer to listen for traffic on port 3000. You Windows people had to
use <span class="stt">Ncat.exe</span>, I believe.</p><p>On another computer, I typed:</p><p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="SVerbatim"><tr><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">$ printf "foobar" | nc 2.3.4.5 3000</span></p></td></tr></table></p><p>This command sends the string "foobar" addressed to IP address
2.3.4.5, on port 3000.</p><p>Recall I said <span style="font-style: italic">internal</span> IP address. Internal, in contrast with
<span style="font-style: italic">external</span> IP addresses. Your own home wireless network has
your devices connected to it&#8212;<wbr></wbr>phone, tablet, laptop, printer, etc.
And those can directly see and talk with each other. But your friend&#8217;s
computer isn&rsquo;t on your local network&#8212;<wbr></wbr>your friend&#8217;s computer is at
his house, on <span style="font-style: italic">his</span> local wireless network. For that matter,
Google&#8217;s web server isn&rsquo;t at your house on your own wireless network.</p><p>Each of those networks&#8212;<wbr></wbr>yours, your friend&rsquo;s, and Google&rsquo;s&#8212;<wbr></wbr>has a
router on it. When you try and communicate with Google or your
friend&rsquo;s computer, their router is where that information crosses over
from outside the external network to inside the internal network. The
router&rsquo;s job is to send good traffic along to where it&#8217;s supposed to
go inside that internal network, and filter out malicious or bad
traffic. When your browser talks with Google, Google&rsquo;s router sends
that traffic to their web server along port 80. But Google&rsquo;s router
won&rsquo;t do that with traffic intended for port 25. The router sends
traffic on that port to a different machine, the email server. There
are rules set up to tell the router which traffic to route where,
based on the port it&#8217;s communicating on. And some traffic, on ports
that aren&rsquo;t <span style="font-style: italic">open</span>, won&rsquo;t get routed on anywhere.</p><p>So, those of you who are <span style="font-style: italic">listening</span> for incoming TCP
connections on your local home network may need to do some configuring
of your router to make sure that your router knows to forward traffic
on whatever port your partner is communicating to your machine.</p><p><img style="vertical-align: 0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict_11.png" alt="image" width="707" height="7"/></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Wed, October 12, 2022 7:43:28 PM</span></p><p>As per our in-class discussion, please notice that the due date for

internet, experimenting and debugging.</p><p>If you find yourself in this situation, you might start by typing into
your search engine the question that you were going to ask your
instructor, and then refine it from there. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t
know the right way to ask for help on the internet,

You can, as we discussed use the <span class="stt">GIT_SSH_COMMAND</span> environment
variable with your commands. This will become tiresome. In your
repository&#8217;s <span class="stt">.git</span> directory you will find a <span class="stt">config</span> file. You
can edit this file by hand to add the key <span class="stt">core.sshCommand</span> and the
associated correct value. It&#8217;s probably safer to use the <span class="stt">git
config</span> command (presumably with the <span class="nobreak"><span class="stt">--local</span></span> flag if this
is not your usual SSH key).</p><p><img style="vertical-align: 0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict_22.png" alt="image" width="707" height="7"/></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Fri, September 9, 2022 3:10:08 PM</span></p><p>FYI to the Pythonistas out there, <span class="stt">sciris</span> already <span style="font-style: italic">has</span>
Python version 3.6.8 available to you, via the <span class="stt">python3</span> command
(this is a pretty common practice). However, I went ahead and build
and installed Python 3.10.7 entirely in my own user-directory, without
root privileges, if for no other reason than to show that you can do
it too.</p><p><img src="python.png" alt="See?" width="606" height="137"/></p><p><img style="vertical-align: 0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict_23.png" alt="image" width="707" height="7"/></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Fri, September 9, 2022 2:46:02 PM</span>
Welcome to the Fall 2022 edition of Software Engineering I. As always,
